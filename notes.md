  - this is a similar project where he thinks that the transmitter is a copy of a nRF24L01 hence the PDF in this folder
- controller_eeprom.pdf is supposedly the eeprom for the controller
- possible_ARM_datasheet.pdf is the possible datasheet for the microcontroller on the quad

- The picture above shows my poor soldering job to the antenna. The blue wire represents CIPO/MISO, yellow SCK, black GND, green COPI/MOSI. By the time I got used to my new soldering iron, I partially tore the connection to CIPO/MOSI but I got lucky that the 1k resistor was connected in parallel to this pin.
